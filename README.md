# UOAnimMulAnalyzer
Simple program which shows the Ultima Online mul animations, also it shows all the "internal" data for each idx and mul entry.<br>
It's not mantained, its purpose was to have a better understanding of how the mul animations worked and to write code that would later be integrated in another application, Leviathan.
